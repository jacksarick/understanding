# Understanding

An attempt to understand memes.

Cataloguing memes by five main data points:

- Origin (who made it, or at least where it came from)
- Date (approximate at the very least, ideally first appearance)
- Format (the visual style the meme takes on)
- Content (the literal visual content of the image)
- Genealogy (what is the history required to understand the meme?)
