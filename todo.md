# TODO

## File uploading
I'm segregating meme information from actual file storage, meaning there actually need to be two seperate forms.

First, the user needs to add a photo. This upload will return the object id of an image that can then be passed to the secondary form that enter the tags and id into the primary database.

- [ ] segregate forms
- [ ] get uploading working (unless it works already in which case test it)
- [ ] link two forms, ensure that order matters
- [ ] run the whole thing backwards to load photos

## Everything else
- [ ] Implement an entire fucking website
